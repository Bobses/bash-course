LICENCE              Overview how files in this repository
                     are licenced
resources/           Data neccessary to run the examples
                     and do the exercises.


You should run the script resources/gutenberg/download.sh
before you can do the Project Gutenberg-related exercises.

Run the script in the resources/gutenberg/ directory, i.e.
	cd resources/gutenberg/
	./download.sh

If you want a more fancy .bashrc configuration, e.g. a coloured
output of grep or a colored command prompt, run the install.sh
script from the files_for_home directory.
	cd files_for_home
	./install.sh

Note that this will replace your current .bashrc and your
current .profile in case these files exist.
